# FILETIME Converter

This tool converts Windows FILETIME timestamps into human-readable dates. FILETIME is a Windows-specific format that counts the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601 (UTC).

You can convert a FILETIME using either:

- Method 1: Enter both components of a FILETIME structure:
  - dwLowDateTime - The low-order 32 bits
  - dwHighDateTime - The high-order 32 bits
- Method 2: Enter the complete FILETIME value as:
  - A decimal number (e.g., 132723834270000000)
  - A hexadecimal number with 0x prefix (e.g., 0x1D6A9BE1A7E8000)
