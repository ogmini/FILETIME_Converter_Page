# FILETIME Converter

This tool converts Windows FILETIME values to human-readable dates. A FILETIME structure represents the number of 100-nanosecond intervals that have elapsed since 12:00 A.M. January 1, 1601, in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

Instructions:

- Either enter the dwLowDateTime and dwHighDateTime values from your FILETIME structure
- Or enter a single 64-bit value (can be decimal or hexadecimal with 0x prefix)
- Values can be either signed or unsigned
- The converter will show both the original input and its unsigned equivalent
- Results are displayed in UTC, local time, and ISO format
